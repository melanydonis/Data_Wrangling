Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear, No-one comes near Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there, What does he care?

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go. I'm filling in the cracks that ran through the door And kept my mind from wandering Where it will go. And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. See the people standing there who Disagree and never win And wonder why they don't get in my door. I'm painting the room in a colorful way And when my mind is wandering There I will go. And it doesn't really matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. Silly people run around they worry me And never ask me why they don't get past my door. I'm taking the time for a number of things That weren't important yesterday And I still go. I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go.  Day after day, alone on a hill, The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him, They can see he's just a fool And he never gives an answer. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. Well on the way, head in a cloud, The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud. But nobody ever hears him Or the sound he appearss to make And he never seems to notice. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. And nobody seems to like him, They can tell what he wants to do And he never shows his feelings. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. He never listens to them, He knows that they're the fools They don't like him. The fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.  Your day breaks, your mind aches, You find that all her words of kindness linger on, When she no longer needs you.  She wakes up, she makes up, She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry, She no longer needs you.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.  You want her, you need her, And yet you don't believe her, When she says her love is dead, You think she needs you.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.  You stay home, she goes out, She says that long ago she knew someone but now, He's gone, she doesn't need him.  Your day breaks, your mind aches, There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head, You won't forget her.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.  Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you, Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true, I love you more than ever girl I do.

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here. Here, making each day of the year, Changing my life with a wave of her hand. Nobody can deny that there's something there. There, running my hands through her hair, Both of us thinking how good it can be. Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there. I want her ev'rywhere, and if she's beside me I know I need never care, But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere, Knowing that love is to share, Each one believing that love never dies, Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there. To be there and ev'rywhere, Here, there and ev'rywhere.  Sheep dog standing in the rain. Bull frog doing it again. Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles.

If I trust in you, oh please, Don't run and hide, If I love you too, oh please don't hurt my pride like her.  'Cos I couldn't stand the pain, And I would be sad if our new love was in vain.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high.  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you're gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile, The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone, Can I take you to the pictures Joan. But as she's getting ready to go, a knock come on the door. Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead. Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again, teacher gets annoyed, Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene, She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away, So he waits behind, Writing fifty times I must not be so But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead. P.C. thirty-one said, we've caught a dirty one, Maxwell stands alone Painting testimonial pictures oh oh oh oh. Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free. The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh. But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead. Silver hammer man.  Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park, Shaves in the dark Trying to save paper. Sleeps in a hole in the road Saving up to buy some clothes. Keeps a ten bob note up his nose, Such a mean old man, such a mean old man. His sister Pam works in a shop, She never stops, she's a go getter. Takes him out to look at the Queen, Only place that he's ever been. Always shouts out something obscene, Such a dirty old man, dirty old man.  Long distance information give me Memphis Tennessee.

When I held you near, you were so sincere, Treat me like you did the night before.  This happened once before, When I came to your door, no reply. They said it wasn't you, But I saw you peep through your window, I saw the light, I saw the light, I know that you saw me, 'Cos I looked up to see your face. I tried to telephone, They said that you were not home, that's a lie, 'Cos I know where you've been, I saw you walk in your door, I mearly died, I nearly died, 'Cos you walked hand in hand With another man in my place. If I were you I'd realize that I Love you more than any other guy, And I'll forgive the lies that I Heard before when you gave me no reply.

No reply, no reply.  As I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day, I stopped for just a little while to watch the children play. Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why, he turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry.  I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child. Just like the flowers I'm growing wild. I got no mummy's kisses I got no daddy's smile. Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child.  No mummy's arms to hold me or sue me when I cry, 'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome I wish that I could die. I'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see.  And just like for the other kids it will be a home for me.  I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child. Just like the flowers I'm growing wild. I got no mummy's kisses I got no daddy's smile. Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child.  I once had a girl, Or should I say She once had me. She showed me her room, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood.  She asked me to stay and she told me sit anywhere, So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.  I sat on a rug Biding my time, Drinking her wine. We talked until two, And then she said, 'It's time for bed'.  She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh, I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath.  And when I awoke I was alone, This bird has flown, So I lit a fire, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood.  You know you made me cry, I see no use in wond'ring why, I cried for you. And now, you've changed your mind, I see no reason to change mine, I cried, it's through, oh. Oh, you're giving me the same old line, I'm wond'ring why, You hurt me then, you're back again, No, no, not a second time. You know you made me cry, I see no use in wond'ring why, I cried for you, yeh. And now, you've changed your mind, I see no reason to change mine, I cried, it's through, oh.

Not guilty and I'm not here for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest. I am not trying to be smart, I only want what I can get. I'm really sorry for your ageing head. But like you heard me said: not guilty. No use handing me a writ while I'm trying to do my bit. I don't expect to take your heart. I only want what I can get. I'm really sorry that you're underfed. But like you heard me said: not guilty. Not guilty for looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh. Not guilty for leading you astray on the road to Mandalay. I won't upset the apple cart. I only want what I can get. I'm really sorry that you've been misled. But like you heard me said: not guilty.  I tried to find out what love is all about, and every day it sure lets out. I see my baby I get week in my knees. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees. My pappie told me there'd be times like these. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees. We meet the gang and go to rocking Joes. The cats are something on the heels and toes. I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees. Why must she be such a doggone tease? There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees. She's got a way that makes me act like a fool. Spent my money, then she plays me cool. I beg her for kisses on my bended knees. Oh won't you give me some loving, baby, please please please. Though I keep trying hard to make her mine, one day the wind will blow and the sun will shine. Till that time she puts my heart at ease. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees She locked my heart and threw away the keys. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees, yeah.

I'd ask my friends to come and see an octopus's garden with me. I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade. We would be warm below the storm in our little hide-a-way beneath the waves. Resting our head on the sea bed in an octopus's garden near a cave. We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found. I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade. We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves. Oh what joy for every girl and boy knowing they're happy and they're safe. We would be so happy, you and me, no-one there to tell us what to do, I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden with you.  Oh!

I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you cam here it won't be the same now I'm telling you. You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down, And when I see your smile replacing ev'ry thoughtless frown, Got me escaping from this zoo, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you. If I grow up I'll be a singer, Wearing rings on every finger, Not worrying what they or you say. I'll live and love and maybe some day, Who knows baby, You may comfort me. I may appear to be imperfect, My love is something you can't reject, I'm changing faster than the weather, If you and me should get together, Who knows baby You may comfort me. I want that love of yours To miss that love is something I'd hate, I'll make an early start I'm making sure that I'm not late, For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you. I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you.  My baby says she's trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees, You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I've got my bag, Run to the station. Railman says you've got the wrong location. I've got my bag. Run right home. Then I find I've got the number wrong, Well I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-o, I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-O, I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine.  If you're listening to this song You might think the chords are going wrong But they're not; we just wrote them like that When you're listening late at night You may think the band are not quite right But they are, they just play it like that It doesn't really matter what chords I play What words I say or what time of day it is As it's only a Northern song It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear Or how I fare or if my hair is brown When it's only a Northern song. If you think the harmony Is a little dark and out of key You're correct, there's nobody there. And I told you there's no one there.  Ooh! My soul.

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know. And all the people that come and go Stop and say 'Hello'.  On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain - very strange.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back  In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, A four of fish and finger pies In summer meanwhile back  Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play She is anyway.  In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies... Penny Lane!  Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt? And for all the little piggies life is getting worse, Always having dirt to play around in.  Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts? You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt, Always have clean shirts to play around in.  In their styes with all their backing they don't care what goes on around, In their eyes there's something lacking, What they need's a damn good whacking.  Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggie lives, You can see them out for dinner with their piggie wives, Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt She's killer diller when she's dressed to the hilt. She's the kind of a girl that makes the News of the World. Yes you could say she was attractively built - Yeh.  If the rain comes they run and hide their heads. They might as well be dead, If the rain comes, if the rain comes. When the sun shines they slip into the shade, And sip their lemonade, When the sun shines, when the sun shines. Rain, I don't mind, Shine, the weather's fine. I can show you that when it starts to rain, Everything's the same, I can show you, I can show you. Rain, I don't mind, Shine, the weather's fine. Can you hear me that when it rains and shines, It's just a state of mind, Can you hear me, can you hear me?

I think of you, And things you do, Go round my head, The things you've said, Like I love only you. In my mind there's no sorrow, Don't you know that it's so, There'll be no sad tomorrow, Don't you know that it's so.

Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you, I left you far behind The ruins of the life that you had in mind. And though you still can't see, I know your mind's made up, You're gonna cause more misery. Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you. Although your mind's opaque, Try thinking more, If just for your own sake. The future still looks good, And you've got time to rectify All the things that you should. Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you.

Turn off your mind relax and float down-stream, It is not dying, it is not dying, Lay down all thought surrender to the void, It is shining, it is shining.  That you may see the meaning of within, It is being, it is being, That love is all and love is everyone, It is knowing, it is knowing.  That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead, It is believing, it is believing, But listen to the color of your dreams, It is not living, it is not living.  Or play the game "existence" to the end. Of the beginning, of the beginning. Of the beginning. Of the beginning.  Running to and fro, hard working at the mill, never failed at the mill, there come a rotten bill.

(shake it up baby)  Two of us riding nowhere Spending someone's hard earned pay, You and me Sunday driving, Not arriving on our way back home.  We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're going home.  Two of us sending postcards Writing letters on my wall. You and me burning matches, Lifting latches on our way back home.  We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're going home.  You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead  Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun. You and me chasing paper, Getting nowhere on our way back home.  We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're on our way home.  You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead]  Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun. You and me chasing paper, Getting nowhere on our way back home  We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're on our way home.  It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home, I've been away now, oh how I've been alone, Wait till I come back to your side, We'll forget the tears we cried.  But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away, And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay, Wait till I come back to your side, We'll forget the tears we cried.  I feel as though you ought to know That I've been good, as good as I can be, And if you do, I'll trust in you, And know that you will wait for me.  It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home, I've been away now, oh how I've been alone, Wait till I come back to your side, We'll forget the tears we cried.

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home, I've been away now, oh how I've been alone,  Try to see it my way, Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? While you see it your way, Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.  We can work it out. We can work it out.  Think of what you're saying, You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright, Think of what I'm saying,  We can work it out and get it straight, or say good-night. We can work it out. We can work it out.  Life is very short, and there's no time, For fussing and fighting, my friend, I have always though that it's a crime, So I will ask you once again.  Try to see it my way, Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong, While you see your way, There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.  Life is very short, and there's no time, For fussing and fighting, my friend, I have always thought that it's a crime, So I will ask you once again.

What goes on in your heart, What goes on in your mind? You are tearing me apart, When you treat me so unkind, What goes on in your mind?  The other day I saw you, As I walked along the road, But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold.  It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, Tell my why? What goes on in your heart, What goes on in your mind? You are tearing me apart, When you treat me so unkind, What goes on in your mind?  I met you in the morning, Waiting for the tides of time, But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind.  It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, Tell me why? What goes on in your heart.  I used to think of no-one else, But you were just the same, You didn't even think of me As someone with a name, Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die, Tell me why?  What goes on in your heart, What goes on in your mind? You are tearing me apart, When you treat me so unkind, What goes on in your mind?  Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely, Would it be too much to ask of you, What you're doing to me?  You got me running and there's no fun in it, Why should it be so much to ask of you, What you're doing to me?

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho, I got a whole lot of things to tell her, When I get home - Yeah.  When I get older losing my hair, Many years from now. Will you still be sending me a Valentine Birthday greetings bottle of wine.  If I'd been out till quarter to three Would you lock the door. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four.  You'll be older too, And if you say the word, I could stay with you.  I could be handy, mending a fuse When your lights have gone. You can knit a sweater by the fireside Sunday morning go for a ride.  Doing the garden, digging the weeds, Who could ask for more. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, When I'm sixty-four.  Every summer we can rent a cottage, In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear We shall scrimp and save  Grandchildren on your knee Vera Chuck & Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line, Stating point of view  Indicate precisely what you mean to say Yours sincerely, wasting away Give me your answer, fill in a form Mine for evermore.  Will you still need me, will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four.  I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps. I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps.  I don't know why nobody told you How to unfold your love, I don't know how someone controlled you They bought and sold you.  I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps. With every mistake we must surely be learning, Still my guitar gently weeps.  I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too. I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you.  I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping, While my guitar gently weeps. I then look at you all, Still my guitar gently weeps.  Why why can't we love again? Why why are you shy on love?  If you only knew how much I love you, why can't you love me again? Why why don't you open your heart? Why why are we so far apart? If you only knew how much I love you, why can't you love me again?  I just want your loving arms around me, yeah, I got to find a way to make you take me back. Baby won't you tell me why why why why are we so far apart? Why why don't you open your heart? If you only knew how much I love you, why can't you love me again?  I just want your loving arms around me, yeah, I got to find a way to make you take me back. Baby won't you tell me why why why why are we so far apart? Why why don't you open your heart? If you only knew how much I love you, why can't you love me why can't you love me why can't you love me again?  Why don't we do it in the road? No one will be watching us. Why don't we do it in the road?  Honey pie Honey pie Honey pie Honey pie hello\x85  What would you think if I sang out of tune, Would you stand up and walk out on me. Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song, And I'll try not to sing out of key.  I get by with a little help from my friends, I get high with a little help from my friends, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.  What do I do when my love is away. (Does it worry you to be alone) How do I feel by the end of the day (Are you sad because you're on your own)  No I get by with a little help from my friends, I get high with a little help from my friends, Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.  Do you need anybody, I need somebody to love. Could it be anybody I want somebody to love.  Do you believe in love at first sight, Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time. What do you see when you turn out the light, I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.  Oh I get by with a little help from my friends. I get high with a little help from my friends, Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.  Do you need anybody, I just need somebody to love, Could it be anybody, I want somebody to love.  Oh I get by with a little help from my friends, Mm I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends, Oh I get high with a little help from my friends, Yes I get by with a little help from my friends.  We were talking - about the space between us all And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth - then it\x92s far too late - when they pass away.  We were talking - about the love we all could share - when we find it To try our best to hold it there - with our love With our love - we could save the world - if they only knew.  Try to realize it's all within yourself No-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small, And life flows on within you and without you.  We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people, Who gain the world and lose their soul - They don't know - they can't see - are you one of them?  When you've seen beyond yourself - Then you may find peace of mind, is waiting there - And the time will come when you see we're all one, And life flows on within you and without you.  Say the word and you'll be free, Say the word and be like me, Say the word I'm thinking of, Have you heard the word is love. It's so fine, it's sunshine, It's the word love.

Say the word and you'll be free, Say the word and be like me, Say the word I'm thinking of, Have you heard the word is love. It's so fine, it's sunshine, It's the word love. Now that I know what I feel must be right, I mean to show ev'rybody the light, Give the word a chance to say, That the word is just the way, It's the word I'm thinking of, And the only word is love, It's so fine it's sunshine, It's the word love. Say the word love, Say the word love, Say the word love, Say the word love.
